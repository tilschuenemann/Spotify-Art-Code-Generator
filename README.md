# bring back spotify album + code

![preview](preview.png)

Spotify used to display its album art and spotify code in one picture after clicking the kebab menu. This still works on mobile, but not in the web player nor in the desktop version.

# Usage

```bash
/bin/python bbsac/bbsac.py -h
usage: bbsac.py [-h] -u URIS [URIS ...] [-o OUT]

options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -u URIS [URIS ...]  comma separated Spotify album URI(s)
  -o OUT              path to output folder
```
